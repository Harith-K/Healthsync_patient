-- Step 1: Calculate mentions for each team in HOMEDESCRIPTION and VISITORDESCRIPTION
WITH team_mentions AS (
    SELECT

    WHERE 
        PLAYER1_TEAM_CITY IS NOT NULL

-- Step 2: Identify the team with maximum mentions in HOMEDESCRIPTION as home team

-- Step 4: Combine home and visitor teams for each game
